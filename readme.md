The features that were used for this project are:

1. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
        - User can edit the list of categories to include in their budget tracker by editing the included categories.txt

2. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
        - Added a text navigation menu that user can use repeatedly or has the option to quit the program altogether
